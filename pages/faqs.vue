      <div class="text-xl font-black">Why didn’t you showcase my collection?</div>
      <div class="ml-4">
        There can be many reasons why your collection was not showcased, but here are the most common ones:
        <div>
          <div>- The design is low quality which will then look bad when printed.</div>
          <div>- You don't have the rights to sell the design that you used.</div>
          <div>- It is not yet finished. (We will give you key points on the parts that you might have missed.)</div>
